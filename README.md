# Data for Policy 2019

This repo contains my notes for the conference [Data for Policy](http://dataforpolicy.org/) 2019.

## Monday Pre-Conference Workshops

### Morning

#### Data Stewardship in Action: Workshop on Making Data Collaboratives Systematic, Sustainable and Responsible

Stefaan Verhulst

* [Data Collaboratives](http://datacollaboratives.org/)

* 250 examples of the private and public sector work together with data.

* A whole spectrum to sharing data and collaboratives. From fully open data to fully shared results (with fully restricted data)

* Many ways to run a collaborative depending on several variables (openness, timing, type of work, focus, etc)

* Are there any evidence of what works better withing the spectrum of the conditionality matrix of open-restrictive/different levels of collaboratives? It varies on case-by-case scenarios. There is a paper in the making for guiding what strategy is better depending on the variables (e.g., scope, access, data, collaboration) you have for a project

* Big challenge to any collaborative sustainable

* A lot of data important for the public resides in the private sector. Reciprocity from the public sector is the main incentive for corporations to share some of the data. There is also reputation, doing research, social responsability, rataining of talent (data scientists in industry may be more motivated to stay in a company where they have access to data for the public good such as, for example, UNICEF)

* There is a large cultural challenge between herding data and sharing it. "Often people do not get promoted for sharing data, but because nothing bad happenned with the data"

Slides will be shared.
