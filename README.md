# Data for Policy 2019

This repo contains my notes for the conference [Data for Policy](http://dataforpolicy.org/) 2019.

## Monday Pre-Conference Workshops

### Morning

#### Data Stewardship in Action: Workshop on Making Data Collaboratives Systematic, Sustainable and Responsible

Stefaan Verhulst

#### [Data Collaboratives](http://datacollaboratives.org/)

* 250 examples of the private and public sector work together with data.

* A whole spectrum to sharing data and collaboratives. From fully open data to fully shared results (with fully restricted data)

* Many ways to run a collaborative depending on several variables (openness, timing, type of work, focus, etc)

* Are there any evidence of what works better withing the spectrum of the conditionality matrix of open-restrictive/different levels of collaboratives? It varies on case-by-case scenarios. There is a paper in the making for guiding what strategy is better depending on the variables (e.g., scope, access, data, collaboration) you have for a project

* Big challenge to any collaborative sustainable

* A lot of data important for the public resides in the private sector. Reciprocity from the public sector is the main incentive for corporations to share some of the data. There is also reputation, doing research, social responsability, rataining of talent (data scientists in industry may be more motivated to stay in a company where they have access to data for the public good such as, for example, UNICEF)

* There is a large cultural challenge between herding data and sharing it. "Often people do not get promoted for sharing data, but because nothing bad happenned with the data"

* Does data sharing have to be free? We need to have the hard convo about financial sustainability

* There are also ethical considerations. Multiple risks: privacy, ethical, competitive

* With private sector it is helpful to ask for data in a customer-centric framework than in a data-centric way. Customer-centric: what questions are you interested in answering? why can't you? the data are not available. Hey, your customer needs these data.

* If you don't share any data,but only the insights from that data? Not solved. There is room for trusted organizations that audit the insights from data without disclosing the data.

#### [Data Stewardship](https://medium.com/data-stewards-network) - The role of the chief data steward

* Make data collaboratives: sustainable, sistematic, and responsible - a gobernance model

* Repository of contracts: Contractual wheel of data collaboration. To help the legal conversation about data and make it more systematic

* [The 100 questions initiative](https://the100questions.org)

* Trying to go beyond prototypes and make data use for public policy sustainable. 

* One way is to have a Data Stewards (in the interest of public interest) - a person within each organization that can connect with the data. Other functions: There is also a need to create the data marketplace + Build the community of practice

* The Cambridge Analytica made it clear that even partnership with academia can turn into disaster. It's important to have data stewards to know who to partner with

* The public sector can help making this work in the private sector in a self-regulatory framework by asking the private sector to make the private sector work on this (carrot/stick approach - the stick is the shadow of the public sector helping this happenning)

* Secondary use debate: data was collected for one purpose but insight is usually extracted as a secondary use of that data. The use for secondary analyses is a case GDPR does not talk about. 

* We already have chief data security officers. Now we would need to have the same need for data stewardship. National stats agencies are data stewards. There are connections to be made with them and a commmunity to build.

### Afternoon


#### Data Sharing & Data Trusts

Gefion Thuermer, Johanna Walker

* Follows with the previous workshop, but independent. More practical. Success cases and tips for sharing data.

#### Session 1: Why is data sharing important? - Johanna Walker

* Data sharing economy. Motivation: "data economy may increase to 739 billion euros by 2020"

* "Data sharing club" (yes, quite similar to belonging to a club where you pay a bit to belong, entrants may get in for free, if the fullfil some reqs) vs open/close platforms for sharing data

* Challenges to solve. Incentives, broader than industry sectors, conditions, match supply and demand, trust (to not abuse your data and behave responsibly with your data).

* Ecosystem examples. Data sharing incubators and caccelerators. Intearnational data spaces; BDVA-PPP I - space; ODI

* [Data Pitch](http://www.datapitch.eu) - a data sharing case study. European open, data/driven innovation program. Innovators, enterpeneurs, data providers, ...


* Data provider challenges: it took a year to get data providers involved, identify the data and problem to include in the pitch. 8 months to define challenge and review legal aspects of data. 4 months to agree on a contract. 2 months to obtain metadata sample


* Case: Greiner Packaging International3. Ended up matched with five innovators who are now working on advancing different areas of thier business. They had a person dedicated to advance data driven innovation - we could say it is a data steward


#### Session 2: Data sharing and trust

Kieron O'Hara, Jack Springman

* Results? Often, you look down the water and you just see the risks (i.e. sharks)

* Ethical data stewardship: regulation is not enough (...) Institutions for trust (e.g., Data trusts/data sharing clubs)

##### Data mobility infrastructure

* The data portability growth oportunity for the UK economy - 2018 report: 

* Advantages: economic benefits, accelerate innovation, healthier markets, improve productivity

* Issues: consumer services and applications, adaptives regulation, infrastructure, and two more

* Personal data mobility sandbox. BT, British Gas, Barclays BBC, fb. With *observers*: Centre for data ethics and innovations, consumers international dcms, ico, university of southampton. The purpose is to demonstrate safe data sharing for people to share their personal data.

* GDPR does not make it easy to share the data/data mobility between individuals and different institutions.

* From data portability do data mobility.A vision: using a data facilitator like "dgme" with apis from different companies (e.g., fb, spotify, etc) - individuals import/export their data from the different companies in a safe and ethical environment. it was important to test the user experience about perception of  security and privacy. 

* What do people/companies get in return? Value was discussed with data importers/provided.

* Report can be found at the [Ctrl-Shift website](http://www.ctrl-shift.co.uk)

* It has to be safe and valuable to share data.

#### Session 3: Increasing access to data while retaining trust

Jack Hardinges, Peter Wells, [Open Data Institute](http://theodi.org)

* ODI mission: works with companies andgovernments to build an open trusworthy data ecosystem.

* ODI vision: we want a world where data works for evyerone. Non-naive idealists. Long-term goal

* ODI works through the complete data sprectrum: smal/medium/(meaningless) big data - public, commercial, etc

* Data is infrastructure. We see it more when it is not working. It should be more boring than it usually is.

* Trust and trustworthiness is highly context-dependent.

* Which data access models give people increased access to data while retaining trust?

* Trust : A general definition of rust (Kieron O'Hara, 2012). BURRITOS model. *B*etter *U*nderstanding the *R*esponsibilities and *R*ationales *I*nforming *T*rustworthy *O*ptions for *S*haring, but a better way to talk about taxonnomy is "The map of data access" which will be published in about three weeks with a travel guide over the map

* For example, some areas of the map require a lot more exploration than others. For example the island Collaborator in the map. If you are in a given part of the map that others explored, the guide will give you hints on what worked for others and what didn't work at a practical level.

* A federation of data explorers? UoS, Datapitch, Govlab, data stweards, big firms, governments, etc

* Case study in the trust island in the map. Data trust as a legal structure that provides independente stewardship of data. The trustess/data stewards of the data trust take on responsibility for how data is used and shared, take liabilities.

* Several related examples: genomics england access commitee, office for nationals tats secure research service, NHS health research authority confidentiality advisory group, metadac, etc, etc, etc.
