# Data for Policy 2019

This repo contains my notes for the conference [Data for Policy](http://dataforpolicy.org/) 2019.

## Monday Pre-Conference Workshops

### Morning

#### Data Stewardship in Action: Workshop on Making Data Collaboratives Systematic, Sustainable and Responsible

Stefaan Verhulst

#### [Data Collaboratives](http://datacollaboratives.org/)

* 250 examples of the private and public sector work together with data.

* A whole spectrum to sharing data and collaboratives. From fully open data to fully shared results (with fully restricted data)

* Many ways to run a collaborative depending on several variables (openness, timing, type of work, focus, etc)

* Are there any evidence of what works better withing the spectrum of the conditionality matrix of open-restrictive/different levels of collaboratives? It varies on case-by-case scenarios. There is a paper in the making for guiding what strategy is better depending on the variables (e.g., scope, access, data, collaboration) you have for a project

* Big challenge to any collaborative sustainable

* A lot of data important for the public resides in the private sector. Reciprocity from the public sector is the main incentive for corporations to share some of the data. There is also reputation, doing research, social responsability, rataining of talent (data scientists in industry may be more motivated to stay in a company where they have access to data for the public good such as, for example, UNICEF)

* There is a large cultural challenge between herding data and sharing it. "Often people do not get promoted for sharing data, but because nothing bad happenned with the data"

* Does data sharing have to be free? We need to have the hard convo about financial sustainability

* There are also ethical considerations. Multiple risks: privacy, ethical, competitive

* With private sector it is helpful to ask for data in a customer-centric framework than in a data-centric way. Customer-centric: what questions are you interested in answering? why can't you? the data are not available. Hey, your customer needs these data.

* If you don't share any data,but only the insights from that data? Not solved. There is room for trusted organizations that audit the insights from data without disclosing the data.

#### [Data Stewardship](https://medium.com/data-stewards-network) - Teh role of the chief data steward

* Make data collaboratives: sustainable, sistematic, and responsible - a gobernance model

* Repository of contracts: Contractual wheel of data collaboration. To help the legal conversation about data and make it more systematic

* [The 100 questions initiative](https://the100questions.org)

* Trying to go beyond prototypes and make data use for public policy sustainable. 

* One way is to have a Data Stewards - a person within each organization that can connect with the data. Other functions: There is also a need to create the data marketplace + Build the community of practice

* The Cambridge Analytica made it clear that even partnership with academia can turn into disaster. It's important to have data stewards to know who to partner with

* The public sector can help making this work in the private sector in a self-regulatory framework by asking the private sector to make the private sector work on this (carrot/stick approach - the stick is the shadow of the public sector helping this happenning)

* Secondary use debate: data was collected for one purpose but insight is usually extracted as a secondary use of that data. The use for secondary analyses is a case GDPR does not talk about.
